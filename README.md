# Delay-Propagation-in-Freight-Trains
This project was done as a course project for the Simulation class of IEOR, IITB (IE 630). Here I have tried to develop a already available IITB rail simulator using Python and JAVA so that we can incorporate the dynamic delay in the schedule for each passenger trains to check their effect on the frieght trains .
